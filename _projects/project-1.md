Most people consider falls are inevitable in seniors. Wrong! Contrary to the common belief, in most cases accidental falls are preventable.

Globally, falls are a major public health problem.
For people aged 65 years or older, the average health system cost per fall injury in Australia is a substantial A$ 1630.67.
Implementation of effective prevention strategies with a subsequent 25% reduction in the incidence of falls for
the 65+ age group could create a net savings of over A$ 50 million.

Our product "Fall Relief" is born to solve this issue and improve user's lifestyle,
by providing them with a targetedÂ lifestyle plan which includes exercises and dietary regimes catered based on the
user's current deficiency to help them live a better life and reduce the likelihood of falling.
